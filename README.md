This repository shows how to model heat transfer in a generic battery pack during fire test in Q-Bat from QuickerSim. The model consists of 16 Li-ion cells connected in 4s4p circuit, bus bars, connectors, holders and casing and is connected to a reduced-order model (ROM) to model heat transfer in 3D geometry.

The model will simulate batteryâ€™s behavior during fire test, which consists of 3 phases:
*	70 s of direct contact with a fire source
*	60 s of indirect contact with a fire source
*	up to 3 hours of cooling to the ambient temperature
